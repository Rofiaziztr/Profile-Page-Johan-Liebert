This is my project for the final task in a basic course from IDCamp X Dicoding. I'm using basic web programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I've included JQuery for interactivity because it makes things simpler than vanilla JavaScript. It's just a beginner project, so please don't judge me too harshly—I’m just here to learn and have fun!

Note:
1. I often use ChatGPT when I need references or run into problems with my code. It helps make the project look nicer, both for myself and for others who might see it.
2. I’m happy to receive any feedback or suggestions to improve the project or my skills.
3. I use JQuery for smooth scrolling on the navbar
