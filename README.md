This is my project to accomplish the last task in a basic course in event IDCamp X Dicoding
  I use basic web programming language like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And additionally I use JQuery for interactivity and much more simpler than vanilla javascript, It's just a beginner project,
  please don't judge me or hate me so hard, I just want to learn with joy, tysm.

  Note:
  1. I use chatgpt when I need to ask reference or facing a problem with my code in order to makes it seems more nice to see in my eyes first, especially to others that can see this project
  2. I am feel pleasure if there is a criticsm or suggestion to this project or for me. 
  3. I use JQuery for smooth navbar scroll and for the aside part that inside of it there are image and table
